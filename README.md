# Course Journal
1)   **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**   
   This weight-tracking app was created to allow a user to track their daily weight. The goal was to implement a system that feature a login screen, a mechanism to add a daily or goal weight, and to have a database that stored all this info  
2)  **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**    
   The app features two screens: a login and a home screen. The login screen is self-explanatory: it allows the user to create an account and log into the app. The screen does feature account verification.
   The home screen is where the user interacts with their tracked weight data. Here, the user can add a goal weight as well as their daily weights with the ability to delete and alter them as well. The UI design is spaciuos and intuitive
   as it provides proper spacing between text/info and features buttons for interaction.   
4)   **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**    
   My development process was to design the app on paper beforehand and then to spend the time learning the tools such as Java and Android Studio in order to make the design come to fruition. My technique was to essentially just spend more time in development to learn what I needed to.   
6)  **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**   
   Testing involved test cases to ensure proper logic and beta testing. This process was vital because it showed, especially through beta testing, issues with the app. The final beta test revealed that there was an error with the result of a button event with no data, which the testing caught.  
8)  **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**    
   I wanted the app to have scroll functionality instead of a static grid to display user weights. To overcome this, I did some research to find out that a Recycler View format was the solution.  
10)   **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**   
    Connecting the database to the app and getting the data to appear on the screen in a uniform manner demonstrated my abilities in my opinion. It requires frontend and backend work which are an accumulation of my knowledge and skills.
